### The Story of ivendPay: Bringing Crypto Payments to Everyday Life

Back in 2018, a small group of innovators had a bold idea—what if you could use cryptocurrency to pay for things in everyday life, starting with something as simple as a vending machine? From that thought, ivendPay was born. The vision was simple: make cryptocurrency useful in the real world, beyond just online exchanges and digital wallets.

By 2019, that idea had turned into reality. We launched our first crypto-enabled vending machines, and the concept quickly took off at exhibitions. People loved the idea of being able to spend their digital assets on something tangible like can of Coke. It was clear: we had created a new way to use cryptocurrency in daily life, and the demand kept growing.

In 2020, we took it further by integrating cryptocurrency payments into Payment Terminals. This opened up new possibilities—crypto payments were no longer limited to vending machines. Now, bars, restaurants, and basically any place that accepted card payments could use ivendPay to accept digital currencies. Suddenly, crypto payments became much more accessible, wherever you were.

Next came the logical step: making things even more convenient with iOS and Android apps. We wanted to ensure users could manage their crypto payments easily from their phones, so we developed user-friendly apps that did just that. Now, paying with crypto was as easy as a few taps.

Building on that success, we introduced API and e-commerce solutions, allowing merchants to integrate crypto payments into their online stores. With this, we covered a huge chunk of the retail sector, empowering businesses to offer their customers more payment flexibility.

Over the years, ivendPay expanded its offerings, integrating major crypto gateways like Binance Pay and various non-custodial wallets to provide secure, seamless transactions. By 2022, we had opened multiple offices, built an amazing team, and relocated our headquarters to Lisbon, right in the heart of the tech-driven world. That same year, we became the first company in the world to implement NFC crypto payments, allowing for contactless transactions using cryptocurrency—an industry first.

Then in 2024, we entered an exciting new chapter. With a fresh rebranding to IVPAY, we reflected our growth and readiness for the future. We expanded our team, welcomed a new CEO, and launched the IVPAY token, adding even more depth to our ecosystem. Hehe

From vending machines to global crypto payment solutions, ivendPay (now IVPAY) has always aimed to make cryptocurrency practical and easy to use in everyday life. And this is just the beginning.
