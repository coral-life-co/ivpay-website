    We use cookies to:

    - Improve user experience by remembering your preferences.  
    - Provide targeted advertising.

    <br/>

    A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to “remember” your actions or preferences over time. Most browsers support cookies, but you can set your browser to decline them and can delete them whenever you like.

    **What type of cookies do we use?**

    When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called “cookies” on your computer. We and our service providers also use cookies to customize the IVPAY Services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.

    We send a “cookie” to your computer when you log in to your account or otherwise use the IVPAY Services. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we do not need to ask you for your password on each page. Once you logout or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.

    We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your email address on our login page, so that you don't need to retype the email address each time you login to your account.

    We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. We may also collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk and for fraud prevention purposes.

    You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the IVPAY Services on websites that we do not control (for example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or application.)

    **Managing your cookie settings**

    You can manage cookies through the settings of your Internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies. Please note that, if you choose to delete IVPAY cookies, your access to some functionalities and areas of our website may be degraded or restricted.

13. Children’s Data

    Our services are not directed at children under the age of 16\. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete such data.

14. Third-Party Disclosure

    We may disclose your personal data to:

    - Law enforcement authorities, where required by law.  
    - Third-party service providers who assist us in delivering services (subject to strict contractual obligations).

    We ensure that any third-party data processors comply with GDPR and use your personal data only for the purposes specified by us.
